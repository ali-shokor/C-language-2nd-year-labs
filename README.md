C Language Labs (Lab 2 - Lab 6)
👋 Hello Everyone!
I'm Ali Shokor, a second-year student at Lebanese University (LU).

This repository contains solutions to all C programming labs from Lab 2 to Lab 6, covering every exercise with detailed implementations.

📌 About the Solutions
Each exercise is solved based on its core idea, focusing on the fundamental concepts being taught.
The solutions are correct, but they may not always be the most optimal approach.
My goal is to demonstrate the intended logic behind each problem and how to apply it effectively.
🤝 Contribute & Connect
If you find any mistakes, have suggestions for improvements, or need clarification, feel free to open an issue or reach out to me.

Happy coding! 🚀

Best regards,
Ali Shokor
